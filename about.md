# About

sheppard-designs is dedicated to helping small-businesses and startups  
by creating and maintaining the web content that they need to succeed.

## Who am I?

My name is Nathan Sheppard. I am a freelance web devoper with experience in:
  + HTML
  + CSS
  + javascript

## Approach:

There are three main steps for developing a website:

1.  The first step towards developing a useful/attractive website is talking about  
	what you want to accomplish. That is:
	  + Who are you?
	  + What are you offering to customers?
	  + Why should customers choose your business?

2.  After that, the web developer can create an outline for your website. This  
	will include:
	  + What type of website you need.
	  + How many web pages you will need.
	  + What content should be on each page.

3.  Once you agree on the content for the website, the designer can start  
	desiging your website. In this step you will go back and forth with the  
	designer until the website meets your needs.

Finally, your website is ready to be published at this point. All you have to  
do now is to choose a domain name, and publish it!
