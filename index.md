I'm Nathan. I have experience using programming and data to help people achieve their goals.

My carreer and education have provided me with a unique set of skills to come up with innovative solutions. Data analysis, data visualization, and web development are my passion. There is nothing that I enjoy more than working with a group of professionals for a common purpose.
